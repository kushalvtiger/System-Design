# System Design Introduction

## Basics

- Questions
  - What features to work on?
  - How much the system should scale.
  - Donâ€™t use buzz words. 
  - Clear and organized thinking. 
  - Drive discussions. 
- Areas of questions. 
  - Understand Features 
  - Define APIs
  - Availability
  - Latency Performance
  - Scalability
  - Durability
  - Class Diagram
  - Security and Privacy
  - Cost Effective
- Key Concepts
  - Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling
    - Individual System vs Distributed System
  - Consistency Availability Partition Tolerance
    - Only achieve 2/3 can be achieved. 
  - ACID vs BASE
    - Atomic Consistency Isolation Durability: Relation Database
    - Basically, Available Soft State Eventual Consistency: NoSQL
  - Partitioning/Sharding Data
    - Consistent Hashing
  - Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking
  - Strong (NoSQL) vs Eventual Consistency
  - Relational DB vs NoSQL
  - Types of NoSQL
    - Key/Value
    - Wide Column
    - Document based
    - Graph Based
  - Caching (Cannot be the source truth)
  - Data Center -> Racks -> Hosts
  - CPU / Memory / HardDrive /Network Bandwidth\
  - Random vs Sequential Reads and Writes to Disk. 
  - Http vs Http2 vs WebSocket
  - TCP/IP 
  - IPv4 vs IPv6
  - TCP vs UDP
  - DNS Lookup
  - Https vs TLS
  - Public Key Infrastructure vs Certificate Authority
  - Symmetric vs Asymmetric encryption
  - Load Balancer -> L4 vs L7
  - Content Delivery Networks and Edge
  - Bloom Filters & Count-min Sketch
  - Paxos
    - Consensus over distributed hosts
  - Design Patterns and Object-oriented design 
  - Virtual Machines and containers. 
  - Publisher-Subscriber vs Queue
  - Map Reduce
  - Multi-threading, concurrency, locks, synchronization and CAS Compare and Swap.
